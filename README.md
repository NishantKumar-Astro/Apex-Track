# ApexTrack – IT Asset Management System

ApexTrack is a secure REST API for tracking IT assets (laptops, servers, monitors) assigned to employees. It automatically calculates decommission dates and asset status (ACTIVE/DECOMMISSIONED). 
Built with Spring Boot, 
JWT authentication,
Postman,
PostgreSQL.

## ✨ Features

- **Testing** - Junit and Mockito                                                      
- **Employee Management** – Register employees (users) with secure login (JWT)
- **Asset Tracking** – Add, update, delete, and view assets
- **Automatic Decommission** – Assets are decommissioned 4 years after assignment (configurable)
- **Status Calculation** – Assets are automatically marked ACTIVE or DECOMMISSIONED based on current date

- **Custom Queries** – Filter assets by status (active/decommissioned) or by employee
- **Upgrade Notifications** – Identify assets needing upgrade (within 30 days of decommission)

- Maven                                
- PostgreSQL (optional, H2 works out-of-the-box)                                  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**                                        
   bash                                          
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ApexTrack.git                                        
   cd ApexTrack                                              

2. Configure database (skip for H2)
   Edit src/main/resources/application.properties:                    
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/apextrack_db                  
   spring.datasource.username=yourusername                                    
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword                          
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update                                         

3.Build and run
 bash
 mvn clean install
 mvn spring-boot:run
 API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

Decommission date = assignment date + 4 years (configurable in AssetService)                                          

Status:                                

ACTIVE – if current date ≤ decommission date                                                    

DECOMMISSIONED – if current date > decommission date                                                  

Upgrade needed – assets with decommission date within the next 30 days
