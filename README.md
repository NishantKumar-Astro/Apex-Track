ApexTrack is a secure REST API for tracking IT assets (laptops, servers, monitors) assigned to employees. It automatically calculates decommission dates and asset status (ACTIVE/DECOMMISSIONED). 
Built with Spring Boot, 
JWT authentication,
Postman,
PostgreSQL.

## 🚄 Deployment Platform- Railway      (Currently on status: Undeployed due to lack of money)                                           
https://apex-track-production.up.railway.app/swagger-ui/index.html#/

## ✨ Features

- **Testing** - Junit and Mockito                                                      
- **Employee Management** – Register employees (users) with secure login (JWT)
- **Asset Tracking** – Add, update, delete, and view assets
- **Automatic Decommission** – Assets are decommissioned 4 years after assignment (configurable)
- **Status Calculation** – Assets are automatically marked ACTIVE or DECOMMISSIONED based on current date
- **Employee‑Asset Relationship** – Each asset can be assigned to an employee
- **Custom Queries** – Filter assets by status (active/decommissioned) or by employee
- **Upgrade Notifications** – Identify assets needing upgrade (within 30 days of decommission)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 21**                                                  
- **Spring Boot 3.5.9** (Web, Security, Data JPA)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21                                    
- Maven                                
- PostgreSQL (optional, H2 works out-of-the-box)                                  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**                                        
      ```bash                                          
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ApexTrack.git                                        
      cd ApexTrack                                              

2. Configure database (skip for H2)
```
   Edit src/main/resources/application.properties:                    
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/apextrack_db                  
   spring.datasource.username=yourusername                                    
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword                          
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update                                         
```
3.Build and run
      ```bash
      mvn clean install
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```
API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

Get assets needing upgrade (within 30 days of decommission)                                            


```text                                                
GET /api/assets/upgrade-needed                                        
🧮 Business Logic                                                    
Decommission date = assignment date + 4 years (configurable in AssetService)                                          

Status:                                

ACTIVE – if current date ≤ decommission date                                                    

DECOMMISSIONED – if current date > decommission date                                                  

Upgrade needed – assets with decommission date within the next 30 days                                            
```
